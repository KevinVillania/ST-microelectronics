# ST-microelectronics sensors breakout board design
Output files of ST Microelectronics sensor breakout board and PCB design
ST Microelectronics sensors designed using Altium Designer 20.

I learned a lot of things from different people coming from different design groups. I appreciate all the help and feedback. Possible use application are for autonomous drone and RC planes

Components used:
HTS221 - Humidity and temperature sensor
LPS22HB - Barometric pressure sensor
LSM9DS1 - 9 DOF IMU sensor.

For my next board I'll try to incorporate it to MCU
